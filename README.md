# ESP8266-based LED dimmer #

This dimmer designed to fit inside a Lival Asymmetria desk lamp. The
plan is to use [LED strips like these][ledstrips] to replace the stock
fluorescent bulb, but other kinds of LEDs should work too, as long as
you adjust the shunt resistor accordingly and don't exceed the 3.3V
regulator's ratings.
